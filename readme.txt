This is my submission for the backend internship.
The api is creating for an mySQL db using PDO so it can be easily modified just by modifying the DB specifier.
I also added 2 sample tables to use.

Task 1 and 2 are succesfully done (at least I think so).
Task 2 was done using a basic auth with admin authorization for create, update and delete.
